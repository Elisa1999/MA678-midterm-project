# MA678-midterm-project

This is my MA678 Midterm project. 
I would like to explore data from Netflix in this project.

This project explored the relationship between the hidden gems score of videos provided on Netflix, a subscription streaming and production companies in the United States, and their characteristics including genre, the number of awards nominated and the number of languages provided, etc. The multilevel logistic model indicates that TV series are more likely to become hidden gems. And the criteria of the hidden gems not only vary by genre but also time. This report consists of 5 main parts: Introduction, Method, Result, and Discussion.
